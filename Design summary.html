	<p>The primary language used to make this website was the HTML5 markup language. The main reason for pursuing the e-commerce website idea is because it is the most challenging and the most hard of all the available options and I love a challenge. I also chose this because I want to start early on how to make it. Ecommerce is growing every day and offers businesses unique opportunities to connect with their target audience. A well-designed ecommerce store can benefit from providing convenient shopping options for consumers. frfFor many companies, especially small businesses and startups, it can be hard to reach customers in new markets with just a storefront. An ecommerce site enables you to reach new customers online that you couldn’t reach with only brick-and-mortar sales.  </p>

		<p>It is easier to make the web pages presentable using CSS. It is easy to learn and understand and used to control the presentation of an HTML document. CSS helps us to control the text color, font style, the spacing between paragraphs, sizing of columns, layout designs, and many more. It is independent of HTML, and we can use it with any XML-based markup language.

It is recommended to use CSS because the HTML attributes are being deprecated. So, for making HTML pages compatible with future browsers, it is good to start using CSS in HTML pages.CSS provides more detailed attributes than plain HTML to define the look and feel of the website.CSS provides more detailed attributes than plain HTML to define the look and feel of the website.

<br>
CSS is compatible with the older language versions so that we can use CSS with the earlier language versions. Because of this, if the CSS application is developed with the older programming language versions and if the developer combines the same with new improvements, then CSS can be easily implemented with the corresponding changes so the developer can update the existing code successfully. CSS allows the content to be optimized for more than one type of device.</p>

		<p>When starting your journey in web development, the first step is to learn the appropriate programming languages. Of course, with Java web development, your goal is to learn the Java programming language. However, you must also learn CSS and HTML.

HTML and CSS are vital components of any website. HTML is what makes a web page to begin with. When you’re writing code in Java, it becomes an HTML document for web browsers. An understanding of an HTML document’s structure is one part of web development that you must learn, no matter what programming language you use.
<br>
<br>
CSS, on the other hand, is what determines the style of a page and what it looks like. Things such as the colors you use, the fonts, even the layout of the page itself are all aspects of the CSS of a website. CSS is also what helps with making a webpage more responsive. Through CSS rules, it is possible to determine what a website looks like on the desktop and use an entirely different set of rules for mobile users.

While HTML defines what the content of your webpage is, CSS determines the way it looks. You create your web page and its content through Java. When using all of these elements together, it is possible to create any web page you wish.</p>
